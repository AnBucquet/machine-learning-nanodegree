- The ultimate goal of Machine Learning is to have data models that can learn and improve over time. In essence machine learning is making inferences on data from previous examples.

*** Measures of central tendency

Here is a short doc outlining Mean, Median, and Mode http://tinyurl.com/measureOfCenter


- mean
- mode: For a dataset: single number that occured with the highest frequency, for a distribution: range that occured with the highest frquency. Some distributions have no mode for instance the uniform distribution. However some distributions have multiple modes. Distributions are consideres multi-modal when there are two or more distinct clear trends.
